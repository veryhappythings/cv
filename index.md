## About Me

* Location: Witney, Oxfordshire, UK
* Email: [mac@veryhappythings.co.uk](mailto:mac@veryhappythings.co.uk)

I am an engineering leader with over 10 years professional experience in
startups and small companies. I'm a generalist with experience in developing
backend software, increasing site reliability, building infrastructure, driving
quality, pushing DevOps practices, building teams, managing teams and even a
little bit of customer service. I'm good at taking an ambiguous situation,
pulling the next 2 weeks of work out of it, and then tying that back to some
kind of big vision. I'm not so good at long term planning in stable environments.

I've got a lot of experience working remotely and I've done a fair amount of
presenting, including a few talks at PyCon UK. I've even done a bit of event
planning.
